<br>

### **Class-class inheritance (extend)**

+ Class inherits/extends class with no multiple inheritances allowance.

<br>

### **Interface-interface inheritance (extend)**

+ Interface inherits/extends interface with multiple inheritances allowance.

+ Class implements interface with multiple implementations allowance.

<br>

```
  • Class inherits/extends class (No mutiple inhertitance/extention allowed)
  
  • Interface inherits/extends interface (Multiple inheritence/extention allowed)
  
  • Class implements interface (Multiple implementation allowed)
```

<br>

### **Possible combinations**

```
  POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS

    • Class extends Class
    
    • Interface extends Interface(s)
    
    • Class implements Interface(s)
