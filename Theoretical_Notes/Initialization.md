# INITIALIZATION

+ Assigning value to the variable first time is called initialization.
+ *Rule: A variable can not be used without initialization.*

```
    Example

        int num=90;
        int res=(int)Math.sqrt(97);

        Process 1: Variable 'res' of type 'int' will be created.
        Process 2: 'sqrt' method of class 'Math' will be called.
        Process 3: Value returned by 'sqr't method will be converted into 'int'.
        Process 4: Converted value will be assigned to the variable 'res'.
```
