# TYPECASTING

+ Typecasting means to cast the type of variable one kind into another.
+ This can be done either with implicit (automatic) or explicit (manual) typecasting.
+ Typecasting has its effects on return statements (or return values).

### Implicit typecasting

+ Compiler will automatically typecast some of the known entities in one type to another.
+ The manual typecasting isn't needed for this type of conversions.

```
  Implicit typecasting:
    byte → int and long
    short → int and long
    int → long
    byte/short/int/long → float and double
```
