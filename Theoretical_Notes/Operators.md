# OPERATORS

<br>

### **Operators**

+ Operators are predefined.
+ Operators are used to perform several operations such as:
  + Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, division, etc
  + Relational operations: Comparing values
  + Logical operations: Logical needs
  + etc
+ All operators are predefined.

### **Operators examples**

+ Unary operators
  + **Increment operator:** ++
  + **Decrement operator:** --
  + **Not operator:** !

+ Binary operators
  + **Arithmetic operators:** +, -, *, /, %
  + **Arithmetic assignment operators:** +=, -=, /=, *=, %=
  + **Relational operators:** <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
  + **Logical operators:** && (Logical-and), || (Logical-or), ^ (Logical-xor)
  + **Bitwise operators:** & (Bitwise-and), | (Bitwise-or), ^ (Bitwise-xor), << (Bitwise left-shift), >> (Bitwise right-shift)

```
  EXAMPLE
  
    10+20
    Here + is operator 
    10 and 20 are operands for +
```

+ Bitwise "OR" and "AND" operators can work on boolean and integer operands. Can return boolean and integer result based on provided condition.
+ Logical "OR" and "AND" operators can only work on boolean operands. Can return only boolean result.

**Note: Every operator returns a value after performing operation!**
