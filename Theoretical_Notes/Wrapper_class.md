# **WRAPPER CLASS**

<br>

### **Wrapper class**

+ Wrapper class is used to convert the primitive datatype values into objects.

+ For every primitive datatype, there is a Wrapper class.

+ Upto JDK 1.4, the object of Wrapper class was needed to be created manually using "new".

+ In JDK 1.5, the autoboxing and auto-unboxing feature was launched.

  + Purpose of autoboxing was to create Wrapper class's object automatically for the primitive type values.

  + So, from JDK 1.5 onwards, there's no need to create an object of Wrapper class manually using "new".
