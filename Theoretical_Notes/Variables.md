# **VARIABLES**

<br>

### **Variable**

+ It is a named space reserved by program in memory to keep data.

+ Runtime environment will allocate space in memory to the program on demand of program.

+ **Rule:** The type of value (to be assigned to the variable) must be same as the type of variable.

```
  VARIABLE SYNTAX

    â€¢ Command to reserve this space in memory should be as follows:
      <variable_datatype> <variable_name>;

      For example: int a; Here, 'int' is primitive datatype and 'a' is variable's name.
```

<br>

```
  CREATING AND ASSIGNING VALUE TO THE VARIABLE

    int num; // Command to declare/create variable with primitive datatype
    num = 90; // Command to assign value to the variable

  
  VARIABLE INITIALIZATION

    int fruit = "Apple"; // Command to create and initialize the variable
```

<br>

```
  VARIABLE VALUE AND TYPE

        VALUE                                   TYPE

    9 or 900 or 344632                          int
    234464L                                     long
    45.67                                       double
    24.65F                                      float
    '5' or 'A' or '$'                           char
    true or false                               boolean
    "455463224" or "Hello" or "rtr@space.com"   String
```

### **Datatypes**

+ Variable has its datatype that provides size and type of variable.

+ Datatypes are divided into following two categories:

  + Primitive datatypes
  
  + Non primitive datatypes

  <br>

  #### **Primitive datatypes**

  + Every programming language provides set of primitive datatypes.

  + These datatypes are system defined (in-built) datatypes.

  + In Java, there are 8 primitive datatypes:
    
    + byte _(8 bit, Integer value)_
    
    + short _(16 bit, Integer value)_
    
    + int _(32 bit, Integer value)_
    
    + long _(64 bit, Integer value)_
    
    + float _(32 bit, Decimal value)_
    
    + double _(64 bit, Decimal value)_
        
    + boolean _(1 bit, true/false)_
    
    + char _(1 bit, Character value)_
  
  <br>

  #### **Non-primitive datatypes**

  + These datatypes are also known as user-defined datatype, one can define them.

  + Every class and interface in Java are non-primitive datatype.

  + String is most widely used non-primitive datatype.

<br>

### **Types of variables**

+ Instance variables

+ Reference variables

+ Class variables

+ Constant variables _(Technically, only constant or final)_

<br>

### **Variable's types based on scope**

+ Local variables

+ Global variables

<br>

### **Instance variable**

+ Also known as **non-static variables.**

+ These variables that are declared inside the class without using static modifier/keyword.

+ These variables are created each time class is instantiated by JVM, hence each variable is an instance.

+ These variables are created each time object from the class is created _(and process known as instantiation)_.

+ Instance variable can have as many as objects will be created in memory.

+ object's reference is required to access these variables.

+ Instance variable stores the object's data.

<br>

### **Class variable**

+ Also known as **static variables.**

+ These variables are declared inside the class by using static modifier/keyword.

+ These variables are created when class is loaded in memory by JVM via class-loader.

  + **Remember:** A class is loaded only once in the memory during lifecycle of the project.

+ Hence, class variable has only single copy in the memory.

+ Class name is required to access class variables.

+ Object reference can also be given to access these variables.

+ Access modifiers named **public, protected, private, final,** and **static** are allowed in class variable.

<br>

### **Local variable**

+ These variables are declared inside method or constructor.

+ Method's arguments/parameters are also local variables.

+ These variables can't be accessed outside the method or constructor.

+ Only **final** access modifier is used with local variable.

<br>

### **Instance variable vs Reference variable**

  #### **Instance variable**

  + Instance variable stores the object's data.

  + The data of an object is kept in instance variable.

  <br>

  #### **Reference variable**

  + Reference variable is any variable with non-primitive datatype.

  + Reference variable stores the object's reference.

  + The datatype of this variable is either class or an interface.

  + The datatype of reference variable can be any class, or any interface.

    + **Technically, the datatype of reference variable can be any current class, parent class of current class or an interface implemented by that class.**
  
  + Possible types of reference variable:

    + Same class variable

    + Parent class of that class

    + Interface implemented by that class
