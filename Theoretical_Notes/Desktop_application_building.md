# DESKTOP APPLICATION BUILDING

### Desktop application

+ The application that runs on the desktop locally.

+ To make an application, basically three layers are needed:
  + Presentation layer
  + Business layer (Algorithm related)
  + Data layer (To store the game data permanently)

<br>

### Presentation layer

+ It is UI of the application.
+ The role of this layer is only to accept input from the user and display output to the user.

<br>

### Building GUI

+ GUI will be created by assembling several components:
  + Frame, button, label, textbox, passwordbox, etc.

```
  Note: Java says component, HTML says element, C# says control. All are same in task and purpose.
```

+ In Java, every component is represented in the form of an object.
+ Code to create these object(s) will be written by a UI developer.
+ Classes of these components are predefined.

+ Few classes are as follows:
  + JFrame, JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JPasswordField, JCheckBox, JRadioButton, JComboBox, JList, etc.

<br>

### Frame of the UI

+ It is main component of UI and container of other components.
+ Other components like combobox, textfield, checkbox, radiobutton, etc.
+ It is by default invisible and size (width and height) of the frame is also 'zero'.
