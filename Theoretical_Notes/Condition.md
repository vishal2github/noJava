# **CONDITION**

<br>

### **Condition**

+ Define loop, when one wants to write command only once and want to execute that command 'n' number of times.

+ One can define condition by using following way:
  + if condition
  + if-else condition
  + nested-if condition

<br>

```
  NOTE

    • Mutliple-if conditions and nested-if conditioning are
      two different kinds of defining of if condition.

    • Mutliple-if conditions are created when multiple "single-if"
      conditions are defined completely isolated/separate from each other, one after the other.

    • In case of mutliple-if conditions, most likely if-statements should be written first.
```

<br>

### **if condition**

+ Define loop by using only "if".

<br>

### **if-else condition**

+ Defined condition by using "if" with "else" part.

+ "If block" is executed if condition is true, and "else block" is executed if the condition is false.

<br>

```
  IF-ELSE SYNTAX

    if(condition)
    {
      // command or code
    }
    else
    {
      // command or code
    }
```

<br>

### **nested-if condition**

+ "if" condition is created inside "if" condition, and so on.
