# **LOOP**

<br>

### **Loop**

+ Define loop, when one wants to write command only once and want to execute that command "n" number of times.

+ One can define loop by using following ways:
  + for loop
  + nested-for loop
  + while loop
  + do-while loop
  + for-each loop

<br>

```
  NOTE
  
    • Mutliple-for loops and nested-for looping are
      two different kinds of defining of for loop.

    • Mutliple-for loops are created when multiple "single-for"
      conditions are defined completely isolated/separate from
      each other, one after the other.
```

<br>

### **for construct**

+ Define loop by using "for" when number of iterations are known/fixed.

+ This loop is based on following three statements:
  + Initialization
  + Condition
  + Updation (Increment/decrement)

+ An integer type of variable is needed to be declared for initialization.

```
  FOR LOOP SYNTAX

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
      // command(s)
    }
```

<br>

<br>

### **nested-for construct**

+ "For" loop is created inside "for" loop, and so on.

<br>

### **while construct**

+ Define loop by using "while" when number of iterations are unknown/variable.

<br>

### **do-while construct**

+ Define loop by using "while" when number of iterations are unknown/variable.

+ In this case loop will be executed atleast once.
