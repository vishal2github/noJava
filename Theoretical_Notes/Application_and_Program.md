# **APPLICATION AND PROGRAM**

<br>

### **What is application?**

+ It is the set of programs.

+ Following types of applications can by developed using Java:
  + Desktop applications
  + Web applications
  + Enterprise applications
  + Web services/APIs
  + Mobile applications
  + etc...

<br>

### **What is Program?**

+ It is a set of methods.

+ Program calls/invokes method(s) to perform a specific task.

+ In Jave, one will have to write source code of the program and keep it into **".java"** file.
  + Then this file will be given to the compiler.
  + Compiler will compile it and generate **".class"** file.
  + **".class"** file can be treated as program.

<br>

### **Writing source code**

+ Define a class.

+ Inside that class, define at least one method.

+ Inside method, define at least one command.

+ **Important:** Don't forget to define "main" method inside class of program.

<br>

### **Building a program**

+ Three major steps for building a program are:
  + Write source code
  + Save source code
  + Complie source code

<br>

```
  COMPILATION AND INTERPRETATION

    • Compile, then run (C, C++, etc)
    • Interpret, then run (Python, JavaScript, etc)
    • Compile, interpret, and then run (Java)
```

<br>

### **Compilation**

+ Generating executable code from the source code is called **compilation.**

+ This is done by the **compiler.**

+ During compilation, following two tasks are performed:
  + **Parsing:** Errors will be checked and shown to the programmer.
  + **Translation:** High-level language code will be translated into low-level language (Machine understandable code).

+ **Note:** Java compiler doesn't translate Java source code into machine understandable code.
  + Rather, it translates java source code into an intermediate code that is called **byte code** and kept into ".class" file.
