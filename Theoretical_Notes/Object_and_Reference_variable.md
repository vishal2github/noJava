# **OBJECT AND REFERENCE VARIABLE**

<br>

+ Reference variable 'type' will either be a class or an interface, hence, object's reference will be kept in that reference variable.

+ If reference variable has 'type' of class, the object reference of that class or its child class will be kept in that reference variable.

+ If reference varaible argument 'type' is interface, then the object's reference of that class (implementation class, which implements that interface) will be kept in that reference variable.
