# **OOP**

<br>

### **Object oriented programming**

+ Program will create one or more than one objects during execution.

+ Methods called by program will be executed on these objects.

+ **Objects** are created in memory and program use it as container of data _(state of real world entity)_.

+ Object can hold multiple values while variable can hold single value.

+ Object can be shared while variable can't be shared.

+ Creating and destroying object is more expensive than creating and destroying variable.

+ Program will create objects from class.

+ **Class** is **blueprint** of object.

+ Properties (Attributes and behaviours) of the objects are defined inside class.

<br>

### **Creating object**

+ It is also called instantiating class.

+ Every object is an instance of a class.

+ During construction of the object following tasks are performed by JVM:

  + Allocating memory to the object

  + Genereating reference of the object

  + Initializing object

  + Returning reference of the object

<br>

### **Reference of the object**

+ Every object is uniquely identified by an **id**.

+ This **id** is known as the **reference** of an object.

+ **JVM** generates this reference and returns to the program.

+ Program must keep reference of this object.

+ The variable that will keep reference of the object is known as **reference variable**.

+ Datatype of this variable should be that class from which the object is created.
