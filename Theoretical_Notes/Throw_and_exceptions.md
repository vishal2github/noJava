# THROW AND EXCEPTIONS

<br>

### **What and why?**

+ If a method can face abnormal conditions, to tackle those, "throw" keyword will be used inside method's body.
+ If exception is in "checked" category, then in method's signature/prototype, after parathesis, "throws" statement/keyword is required.
+ This "throws" keyword becomes signature's part that will warn caller about method which can face unexptected conditions, and suggest not to call that without "try and catch".
