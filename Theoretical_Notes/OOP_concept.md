# OOP

### Object oriented programming

+ Program will create one or more than one objects during execution.
+ Methods called by program will be executed on these objects.
+ Objects are created in memory and program use it as container of data (state of real world entity).
+ Object can hold multiple values while variable can hold single value.
+ Object can be shared while variable can not be shared.
+ Creating and destroying object is more expensive than creating and destroying variable.
+ Program will create objects from class.
+ Class is blueprint of object.
+ Properties (Attributes and behaviours) of the objects are defined inside class.

### Creating object

+ It is also called instantiating class.
+ Every object is an instance of a class.
+ During construction of the object following tasks are performed by JVM:
  + Allocating memory to the object
  + Genereating reference of the object
  + Initializing object
  + Returning reference of the object
