# **EXCEPTION, EXCEPITON HANDELING, AND FINALLY BLOCK**

### **Exception**

### **Exception handeling**

+ 

<br>

### **Exceptions types**

  #### **Checked exceptions**

  + The exception which can't be stopped are known as "Checked exceptions".

  + "Try and catch" or "Throws" statement is needed to be decalred in this case.

  <br>

  #### **Un-checked exceptions**

  + The exception which can't be prevented are known as "Unchecked exceptions".

<br>

### **Finally block**

+ 

<br>

### **Important points**

+ If overriden method ...

+ Writing throws statement in un-checked exception is unnecessary.

<br>

### **Throw and exception**

<br>

### **What and why?**

+ If a method can face abnormal conditions, to tackle those, "throw" keyword will be used inside method's body.

+ If exception is in "checked" category, then in method's signature/prototype, after parathesis, "throws" statement/keyword is required.

+ This "throws" keyword becomes signature's part that will warn caller about method which can face unexptected conditions, and suggest not to call that without "try and catch".

<br>

### **Throws vs Throw**

+ **Throws** is written within method's signature/prototype to inform the caller that upon invoking certain method could generate the certain exception.

+ **Throw** is used in method's body and not in prototype, used to specifically throw certain error/exception.
