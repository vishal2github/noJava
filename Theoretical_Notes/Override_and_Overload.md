# **OVER-RIDE AND OVER-LOAD**

<br>

### **Method over-riding**

+ Implements "runtime polymorphism".

+ The method call is determined at runtime based on the object type.

+ Occurs between superclass and subclass.

+ Have the same signature (name and method arguments).

+ On error, the effect will be visible at runtime.

+ **Purpose of method over-ride:** When child class has to change the implementation method of its super-class (parent-class) or in case where there's no implementation of super-class.

### **Method over-loading**

+ Implements "compile time polymorphism".

+ The method call is determined at compile time.

+ Occurs between the methods in the same class.

+ Have the same name, but the parameters name/order/quantity are different.

+ On error, it can be caught at compile time.

### **Over-write vs Over-ride**

+ **Over-write:** To "overwrite" something is to put something else in its place, destroying the thing overwritten.

+ **Over-ride:** To "override" something is to cause something else to operate instead of it without harming or changing the thing overridden.
