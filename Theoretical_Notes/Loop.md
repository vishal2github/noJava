# LOOP

<br>

### **Loop**

+ Define loop, when one wants to write command only once and want to execute that command 'n' number of times.

+ One can define loop by using following ways:
  + for loop
  + nested-for loop
  + while loop
  + do-while loop

<br>

```
  NOTE
  
    • Mutliple-for loops and nested-for looping are
      two different kinds of defining of for loop.

    • Mutliple-for loops are created when multiple "single-for"
      conditions are defined completely isolated/separate from each other, one after the other.
```

### **for construct**

+ Define loop by using "for" when no of iterations are known/fixed.

<br>

### **nested-for construct**

+ "For" loop is created inside "for" loop, and so on.

<br>

### **while construct**

+ Define loop by using "while" when no of iterations are unknown/variable.

<br>

### **do-while construct**

+ Define loop by using "while" when no of iterations are unknown/variable.

+ In this case loop will be executed atleast once.
