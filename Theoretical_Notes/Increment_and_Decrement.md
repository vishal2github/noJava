# INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATOR

### Increment operator (++)

+ This operator is used to increase the value of a variable by 1.

```
    Example

        int x=10;
        To increase the value of 'x' variable by 1, following three commands are possible:
          > x=x+1;
          > x+=1;
          > ++x; // prefix
          > x++; // postfix

        Conclusion:
          > In all cases value of variable x will be incremented by 1.
          > Prefix returns the new value of variable.
          > Potfix returns the old value of variable.
```

### Decrement operator (--)

+ This operator is used to decrease the value of a variable by 1


**Note: Every operator returns a value after performing operation.**
